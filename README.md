## üìù Manual Steps Required

1. **GPG Setup for Commit Signing**:
   - Follow the prompts in the script to set up GPG.
   - Generate a new GPG key when prompted.
   - Add the GPG key to your GitHub account (Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New GPG key).
   - Configure git to use the GPG key for signing commits.

2. **SSH Key Setup**:
   - The script will generate an SSH key for you.
   - When prompted, add the SSH key to your GitHub account (Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key).

3. **Homebrew Path**:
   - After the script completes, you may need to add Homebrew to your PATH.
   - Run: `echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile`
   - Then run: `eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"`

4. **Node.js and NVM**:
   - Ensure NVM is properly sourced in your shell. Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
     ```
     export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
     [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
     [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
     ```

5. **Application Setup**:
   - Launch each application and complete any initial setup or login processes.
   - For development tools like VS Code or PyCharm, install any additional extensions or plugins you commonly use.

6. **Cloud Service Logins**:
   - Log in to your accounts for cloud-based services (e.g., Slack, Notion, Microsoft Outlook).

7. **1Password Setup**:
   - Set up your vault and consider enabling integration with your web browsers.

8. **Raycast Configuration**:
   - Customize Raycast with your preferred shortcuts and workflows.

9. **Git Configuration Verification**:
   - Verify your git configuration with `git config --list`
   - Ensure your name, email, and GPG signing preferences are correct.

10. **Terminal Profile**:
    - Consider setting up a custom terminal profile (colors, fonts, etc.) for better productivity.

Remember to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zprofile` after completing all steps to ensure all changes are applied.
